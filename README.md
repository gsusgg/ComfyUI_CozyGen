# CozyGen: A Mobile-Friendly ComfyUI Controller

![ComfyUI Custom Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/ComfyUI-Custom%20Node-blue.svg)

## DISCLAIMER

This project was 100% "vibe-coded" using Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash. I dont code, but wanted to share a working LLM assisted projected. Everything AFTER this disclaimer section is 99% made by an LLM. I just wanted to make dumb cat pictures with my desktop ComfyUI from my phone, so now this exists. Thanks to @acly and the comfyui-tooling-nodes for the inspiration.

Known Issues:

*  If you use a batch higher than 1 they will generate and show in the gallery, but the preview only displays the first image of the batch.

Changelog:
*  9/11/2025 - Update 1
	*NOTE* This update will require you to remake workflows if you already had some. If you run into weird issues, try a complete reinstall if you are upgrading.
		- Added image 2 image support with the "Cozy Gen Image Input" Node
		- Added more robust support for dropdown choices, with option to specify model subfolder with "choice_type" option.
		- Improved gallery view and image overlay modals, with zoom/pinch and pan controls.
		- Added gallery pagination to reduce load of large gallery folders.
		- Added bypass option to dropdown connections. This is mainly intended for loras so you can add multiple to the workflow, but choose which to use from the front end.
		- General improvements (Layout, background functions, etc.)
		- The other stuff that I forgot about but is in here.
		
*  8/29/2025 - Initial release

## ‚ú® Overview

CozyGen is a custom node for ComfyUI that provides a sleek, mobile-friendly web interface to remotely control your ComfyUI server. Designed for ease of use, it allows you to load pre-defined workflows, dynamically adjust parameters, and generate stunning images from any device with a web browser. Say goodbye to the desktop interface and hello to on-the-go creativity!

## üöÄ Features

*   **Modern & Intuitive UI:** A beautiful, mobile-first interface built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a stylish dark theme.
*   **Dynamic Controls:** The user interface automatically generates input controls (text fields, sliders, dropdowns, toggles) based on the `CozyGenDynamicInput` nodes in your ComfyUI workflows.
*   **Priority Sorting:** A "priority" field that determines how the webpage is ordered. A 0 priority will push the field towards the top of the page.
*   **Real-time Previews:** Get instant visual feedback with real-time previews of your generated images directly in the web interface.
*   **Persistent Sessions:** Your selected workflow, input values, and even the last generated image are remembered across browser sessions.
*   **Image Gallery:** Browse, view, and manage all your previously generated images, complete with extracted prompt and seed metadata.
*   **Randomization:** Easily randomize numerical inputs like seeds with a dedicated toggle.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Works directly with your existing ComfyUI setup, leveraging its core functionalities.

</p>

## üì¶ Installation

Node can be installed with the ComfyUI Manager. Search for "CozyGen" to install.

Follow these steps to get CozyGen up and running with your ComfyUI instance.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory and clone this repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/gsusgg/ComfyUI_CozyGen.git
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

(This node only requires aiohttp, which should already be installed with ComfyUI.)

CozyGen requires the aiohttp Python package. Navigate into the `ComfyUI_CozyGen` directory and install them using `pip`.

```bash
cd custom_nodes/ComfyUI_CozyGen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Restart ComfyUI

After completing the above steps, restart your ComfyUI server to load the new custom node and its web interface.

### 4. (Optional) ComfyUI --listen

If you want to use this as a remote to your machine running ComfyUI on the local network, add the "--listen" flag to your ComfyUI startup.

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Workflow

In ComfyUI, create or open a workflow that you want to control remotely. For each parameter you wish to expose to the web UI:

*   Add a `CozyGenDynamicInput` node and connect its output to the desired input on another node.
*   Configure the `CozyGenDynamicInput` node's properties (e.g., `param_name`, `param_type`, `default_value`, `min_value`, `max_value`, `add_randomize_toggle`).
*   Add a `CozyGenOutput` node at the end of your workflow to save the generated image and send real-time previews to the web UI.
*   *IMPORTANT* When exporting your workflow, export with API into the `ComfyUI_CozyGen/workflows/` directory.

*   Some dropdown menus may not automatically populate if the model folder is not a default. Use the choice_type widget to point to the correct models subfolder using its name (ex: loras)

### 2. Access the Web UI

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-comfyui-ip>:8188/cozygen
```

(Replace `<your-comfyui-ip>` with the IP address or hostname where your ComfyUI server is running, e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local access).

### 3. Generate Images

1.  Select your prepared workflow from the dropdown menu.
2.  Adjust the dynamically generated parameters as needed. Your settings will be saved automatically.
3.  Click the "Generate" button.
4.  The generated image will appear in the preview area. You can click it to expand it or use the "Clear" button to reset the panel.
5.  Click the "Gallery" link in the header to browse all your generated images.
